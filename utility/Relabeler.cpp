/***********************************************************************
 * |PothosDoc Relabeler
 *
 * The relabeler block passively forwards a stream of data
 * while applying the labels specified on another stream.
 * The primary input port 0 provides the data stream,
 * while the label input port "lbl" provides the labels.
 * The data and labels are forwarded to output port 0.
 *
 * <b> Note:</b>
 * Both input ports must be used in a synchronous manner,
 * with equal amounts of data fed to each input port.
 *
 * <b>Example usage:</b>
 * Suppose that a signal went through a mathematical transform,
 * and then was labeled to indicate meaningful events in the sample stream.
 * The user doesn't want to use the output of the mathematical transform,
 * instead they want the associated labels annotating the original signal.
 *
 * |category /Utility
 * |keywords stream label
 *
 * |param keepPrimary[Keep Primary] How to handle labels from the primary input port.
 * Labels will always be forwarded from the input labels port,
 * however the user may configure how labels from the primary port are handled.
 * |default false
 * |option [Forward] true
 * |option [Discard] false
 *
